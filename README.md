jQuery Continuous Slider with mobile responsive 2-column layout

A continuous image slider, that loops infinitely until user hovers over it to pause. The slider is mobile responsive too, so even if user resizes the browser size, the slider will adjust accordingly.  I used jQuery, HTML5 Boilerplate to reset layout, CSS position-based layout for overlapping layers, floats for 2-columns, and Media Queries to make it mobile responsive.
